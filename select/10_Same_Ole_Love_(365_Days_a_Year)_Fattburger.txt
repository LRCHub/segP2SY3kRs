Relax with me, Listen to songs,
Sleep in a bit and give a yawn,
All of your pains, laugh them away,
Be a big carefree, it's okay

Life might be hard and you might fall
You might cry but give it your all
If you just wait then you will see
Everything will end happily

I always cheer for you, All your wishes will come true

3-6-5 I'll be here for you
Every morning and night
Right here in your arms
3-6-5 Each time of the day,
Boy, I'm willing to be right here in your arms

Wo-oh-oh, wo-oh-oh-oh,

3-6-5 Our hands together
Wo-oh-oh-oh-wo-oh-oh-oh
365 will help each other
365 in love forever
