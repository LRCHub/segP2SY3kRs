I could be watching a TV show,
Watch it all in a marathon.
Posting pictures off my phone,
Getting stoned on a study loan.
My fingertips got a peachy tone
Another meeting I'll postpone
Reading what you've got to moan about
Evey like is a stepping stone, right?
It's a little bit a shame
You're gonna waste a day
Like this you wanna.
You wanna feel alive you're gonna?
So many ways to spend a day,
A month, a year you gonna.
You've never gonna get another.
You've never gonna get another.
Looking good and it tastes like it
This one will get a million hits
Seen my pins so you think you know me
Still a trainee with bachelors degree
Think we're gonna have an order on
Five bottles yeah I got my spin.
Nights out to the early hours
In this city that we think is ours.
It's a little bit a shame
You're gonna waste a day
Like this you wanna.
You wanna feel alive you're gonna?
So many ways to spend a day,
A month, a year you gonna.
You've never gonna get another.
You've never gonna get another.
It's a little bit a shame
You're gonna waste a day
Like this you wanna.
You wanna feel alive you're gonna?
So many ways to spend a day,
A month, a year you gonna.
You've never gonna get another.
You've never gonna get another.
